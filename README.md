Wordle.py is a clone of the hit New York Times game Wordle. This runs 100% locally in the terminal with 0 HTML. 
It utilizes visual feedback through use of 🟥🟨🟩 emojiis. 
The Words.txt file is a modified version of one that comes from Allen Downey's Think Python book/exercise.

Create.py is also a NYT clone but of the Spelling Bee. It also runs 100% locally in the terminal. It uses an unaltered version of Allen Downeys txt file. It is much worse than the wordle clone. This is caused because A) while the Wordle clone can work with emojis, there isn't a way to good way to display the Spelling Bee B) The words_all_length file has legit words but many are unorthodox and the randomizer can't really determine letter pairings that are /intutitive.  

test.py is a game I made by myself. You are a blue dot and need to avoid the red dot that chases you. The chasing dot speeds up slowly and the area you can be in shrinks so the difficulty increases as you go. 

Blackjack located in the graphics folder is you guessed it Black Jack. This was initally an assignment for AP CSP but it was towards the end of the year so no one really finished, so I worked on it over the summer. It is a simple version that uses the graphics package to display a very rudimentary repersentation but it works so hey if it ain't broke am I right? It actually has two python scripts one to handle the game logic and one to run the graphics. The folder contains a list of card gifs.
